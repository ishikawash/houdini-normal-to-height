This is a demo of reconstructing a height map from a normal map using the Poisson equation.
For self-learning, I remade a similar program based on prior examples on the Internet.

NOTES:
- When I set the grid size and division count to a number other than default value(64), the results of the linear equations are not stable. Why? Please someone tell me how to solve this problem...
